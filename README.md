# Extra Questions
 Some Extra Questions I Solved.
Question 1: Your preparation for the examination should include attempting the following practical tasks by writing
and testing a program or programs.
A program is needed for a quiz to help younger students to practise their multiplication tables. There
needs to be two ways of using the quiz; testing and learning.
Testing: the student is given one attempt at answering each question and the score is calculated for
the whole test.
Learning: the student is given up to three attempts to get their answer to each question correct. There
is no scoring.
A student can choose which multiplication table, from 2 to 12, to use for the quiz. There are five
questions in each quiz, each question must use the chosen multiplication table and a different whole
number (from 1 to 12) as the multiplier.
Write and test a program or programs for a multiplication tables quiz.
• Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data; data must be
validated on entry.
• Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly and understandably.
• All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.
You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.
Task 1 – Testing a student
Students enter their name and choice of multiplication table. Each question is displayed on the screen
one at a time, for example:
Question 1
2 X 7 =
Students enter their answer and move on to the next question. A running total of correct answers
(score) is kept. At the end of the quiz the student’s name and score are displayed with a personalised
message related to the score, for example:
Aarav your score is 5/5
Well done full marks
Diya your score is 3/5
Have another practice
Task 2 – Student learning
Students enter their name and choice of multiplication table. Each question is displayed on the screen
as in Task 1. If an answer is correct, a personalised message containing the student’s name confirms
this, the quiz then moves to the next question. If an answer is incorrect, a personalised message
containing the student’s name and a hint is displayed, for example:
Aarav your answer is too large
Upto three attempts are offered to get each answer correct. After the third incorrect attempt, the correct
answer is displayed and the quiz moves on to the next question.
Task 3 – Varying the quiz
Modify Task 1 to allow students to choose how many questions they would like in the test and if they
would like a ‘mixed’ set of questions. A ‘mixed’ set means that each question can be from a different
multiplication table; from 2 to 12.
